# Shop Example

Shop setup with shopping service, checkout service, payment service and warehouse service. The shop can be used to browse available products and place articles on a shopping cart, the checkout service can be used to order the created cart and the payment service can be used to pay this order. The warehouse service finally allows to ship items. By default, all services are not fully implemented. The communication between each service is not realized and has to be added.

## Prepare

In order to run this example, some additional ressources has to be loaded. This can be done before by using:

```
docker compose pull
docker compose build
```

## Run

- **First Time**, start with: `docker compose up -d init-kafka` (creates topics)
  - Check with `docker compose logs init-kafka`
- **Start all containers** for development: `docker compose up -d`
- Start only Kafka / Zookeeper: `docker compose up -d kafka zookeeper`
- Start only Load Balancer: `docker compose up -d nginx`
- Start only Adapters: `docker compose up -d warehouse-sensor warehouse-adapter`
- Stop: `docker compose stop`
- Remove all containers: `docker compose down`
- Remove all containers, incl. collected data: `docker compose down -v`, e.g., if you face any kafka connection issues use this (mostly because of changed networks)
